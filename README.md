# bible-memorizer
## Anki add-on focused on Bible memorisation

## Tutorial

1. Install this add-on.
2. Open Bible Memorizer (Tools → Bible Memorizer)
3. Copy your scripture into the text box. Each new line is a new note. It is best to add a line break after each verse (one verse per line) or to break the verse into several parts (one part per line). **You should include the verse number at the beginning of each new verse.**
4. For every note there are three cards (or four if you checked the box "Create Table").

## Further Notes
* 1 verse = all lines until a there is a new verse number at the beginning of a line.
* If you don't use verse numbers at all, you are limited to 26 "verses", because there are not more letters in the alphabet :)
* "Table Cards" are only created if you have more then 4 verses.
